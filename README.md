# Deep-Dive-into-Overfitting-and-Underfitting-in-Machine-Learning
This project provides a practical and visual analysis of overfitting and underfitting in machine learning using synthetic datasets. It demonstrates how model complexity, learning curves, regularization, and cross-validation affect model performance, helping build an intuitive understanding of the bias–variance tradeoff.
